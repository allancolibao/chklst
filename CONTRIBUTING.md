# How to contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

Here are the steps to follow in order to properly contribute to the project. 

1. You can start contributing by forking this repo!
2. Once cloned, duplicate the /components/contributors/[[name-sample.json]](https://github.com/crtved/prtflio/blob/main/components/contributors/[name-sample].json) file from your forked repo. 
3. Rename duplicate file, lowercase with no special characters.
